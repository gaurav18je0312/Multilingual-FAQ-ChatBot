            "answer": "In case of QCBS, the weightage is given to both Technical &amp; Financial ranking of bidder, to find the successful bidder.

            "question": "How LCS is better than the L-1 selection Method?",
            "answer": "LCS method is largely similar to the L-1 selection method for procurement of Goods. While in L-1 method, buyer can define the set of pre-qualification conditions (such as turnover/experience/capacity etc.), all of which act as a pass or fail criteria individually. No additional weightage is given to a better qualified bidder. E.g., if minimum average turnover condition is Rs. 1 Cr in last 3 FY, &amp; there are 2 bidders with the average turnover of Rs. 1 Cr &amp; 10 Cr, both bidders are equally eligible to get the award based on their financial bids. However, in case of LCS, the buyer can award score for each qualifying parameter as indicated in the bid document and only those bidders qualify whose total technical score is more than the threshold value."

It is the simplest &amp; quickest system of selection &amp; under normal circumstances, this method of evaluation may be used as default method since it allows for minimum satisfactory technical efficiency with economy."

            "question": "What is the basic Do\u2019s &amp; Don\u2019ts while finalizing the technical criteria in LCS method?",
            "answer": "Below are a few points to keep in mind while deciding the technical criteria in LCS method: \u2022 Technical criteria should be relevant &amp; proportional to the requirement of quality of assignment. \u2022 Selection process should be rigorous enough so that no technically unsatisfactory bid should be able to get through a loose criterion. \u2022 On the other hand, the selection process should not be highly restrictive so that no technical satisfactory bid is ruled out due to a very stringent criterion. \u2022 The evaluation methodology for technical criteria should be as objective as possible. In case of any subjective criterion, a system of grading the responses &amp; their marking may be laid down in the bid document."

Similarly, there is no limit on the number of criteria to be added in the LCS, but normally this can be in the range of 4 to 6 and can vary as per buyer\u2019s requirements. The maximum marks for all the criteria must add up to 100."
